# Natural-Language-Generation-NLG-Project-with-Hugging-Face

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of pretrained models from Hugging Face for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, specifically focused on Natural Language Generation (NLG). The goal is to showcase how Hugging Face’s resources can enhance accuracy and efficiency across multiple NLP tasks.

## Project Features
 * Utilizes various pretrained models from the Hugging Face library to handle multiple NLP tasks, demonstrating high accuracy in each.
 * Explores the effectiveness of Hugging Face models for different NLG applications.
 * Integrates TensorFlow’s pipeline function for streamlined task management and model deployment.

## Requirements
 * Python 3.x 
 * Hugging Face Transformers library 
 * TensorFlow

## Installation 
```
pip install transformers tensorflow
```

## Usage 
Load a model and run it on a sample task:
```
from transformers import pipeline
# Example of loading a text generation model
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt-2')
response = generator("Once upon a time,")
print(response)
```
